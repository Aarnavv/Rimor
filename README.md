### Welcome, to the Vagus Readme Page
This project has been created for academic purposes. It tries to explain the few algorithms behind famous apps like Uber and Google maps. 

An example of how this website looks :

This is basically in a sense, a "maze solver". However, it does not strive to take **just** the path that joins two points but, the most optimal path too. This is why, a host of different algorithms have been provided. 

Thus, it is a tool through which one can **visualise** the algorithms used to find optimal or sub-optimal or required paths joining a number of points.
